DUEL is a fun cowboy inspired game for two players. Each player have a revolver and a small revicer module mounted on their clothing. The purpose of the game is to shoot the other player as fast as possible when a countdown reaches zero. To start the game the trigger is pressed. When the countdown reaches zero, an IMU checks the angle of the revolver to prevent false starts. Shooting is then done using IR transmitters.
